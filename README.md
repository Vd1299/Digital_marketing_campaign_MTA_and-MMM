# Marketing Attribution Analysis: Multi-Touch Attribution & Marketing Mix Modeling

A comprehensive data science project for analyzing marketing channel performance using Multi-Touch Attribution (MTA) and Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) techniques.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains a complete pipeline for marketing attribution analysis, helping businesses understand:
- Which marketing channels drive the most conversions
- How customers journey across multiple touchpoints
- Optimal budget allocation across marketing channels
- ROI and efficiency metrics for each channel

## 📊 Key Features

- **Multi-Touch Attribution (MTA)**: Customer journey analysis and channel attribution modeling
- **Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)**: Statistical modeling to quantify channel contributions
- **ROI Analysis**: Cost per conversion and revenue efficiency metrics
- **Budget Optimization**: Data-driven recommendations for marketing spend allocation
- **Customer Segmentation**: First-touch vs multi-touch customer analysis

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- **Statistical Analysis**: Attribution modeling, coefficient analysis
- **Data Visualization**: Channel performance dashboards and insights

## 📈 Analysis Components

1. **Data Cleaning & Validation**: Ensures data quality and business logic consistency
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Channel distribution and conversion patterns
3. **Feature Engineering**: Customer value scores, engagement metrics, efficiency indicators
4. **Attribution Modeling**: Shapley value approximation and journey reconstruction
5. **Marketing Mix Model**: Logistic regression with channel contribution analysis
6. **Performance Optimization**: Budget reallocation recommendations

## 📋 Dataset Requirements

Your marketing dataset should include:
- Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Income)
- Campaign details (Channel, Type, AdSpend)
- Engagement metrics (CTR, Website visits, Email opens)
- Conversion outcomes (Binary target variable)

## 📊 Key Outputs

- **Channel Performance Rankings**: Conversion rates and efficiency scores
- **Attribution Analysis**: Direct and assisted conversion attribution
- **Budget Recommendations**: Increase/maintain/decrease suggestions per channel
- **Customer Journey Insights**: Multi-touch vs first-touch performance
- **ROI Metrics**: Cost per conversion and revenue per dollar spent

## 🎯 Business Impact

This analysis helps marketing teams:
- **Optimize budget allocation** across channels (typical 15-25% efficiency gains)
- **Identify underperforming channels** for optimization or reallocation
- **Understand customer journey complexity** and touchpoint importance
- **Make data-driven decisions** instead of last-click attribution assumptions
